# Student Course System

A simple full-stack web application for managing students, courses, and enrollments. Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Student Management** — Add, view, and delete students
- **Course Management** — Add, view, and delete courses
- **Enrollment Management** — Enroll students in courses via dropdown selectors, view all enrollments
- **Business Rules** — No duplicate enrollments, cascade delete (removing a student/course removes related enrollments)
- **Validation** — Input validation on both frontend forms and backend API
- **In-Memory Storage** — No database required; data lives in memory while the server runs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mousetouch5/SAR2.git
cd SAR2
npm install
```

### Run the Server

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:3000**.

### Seed Sample Data (Optional)

With the server running, open a second terminal:

```bash
node seed.js
```

This creates 4 students, 4 courses, and 8 enrollments for testing.
